until a passing grade or presentation over the event is provided.
- Employees must complete the Tuition Reimbursement form and the form must collect required information: basic employee information, date, time, location, description, cost, grading format (grade or presentation), event type, work-related justification, work time that will be missed, projected reimbursement, and optionally event-related attachments.
